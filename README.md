# GroupThink
Final Project CS183 (UCSC Fall 2016)
#### What is GroupThink?
* GroupThink facilitates team formation for the purpose of developing and collaborating on group projects in an educational environment.
* The platform allows professors to create private and organized spaces for students to post project ideas and join existing projects.
* Using user profiles, GroupThink will match students with other member of their class based on technical skills, schedule, prior coursework, project ideas, and interests.

#### Motivation

* Traditional team forming for group projects is a haphazard process that puts stress on individuals and leads to disjoint groups.
* Current tools used for group projects (i.e. Google Sheets, Piazza Forms) are unorganized and lack functionality.
* By matching students based on their profiles and project goals, GroupThink will help create groups that work and learn better together.
* It is also a reaction to the faculty to student ratio at UCSC. Many classes now have to rely on group projects to make grading possible. This can be a great learning experience but can be a hurdle for many students that struggle to find a group they fit into.
